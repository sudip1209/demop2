 *************************



# The Fibonacci series is a series of numbers where a number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, starting from 0 and 1.

# Program for Fibonacci series in Python

def fibonacci(n): 
   if n<0: 
      print("Incorrect input") 
# First and second numbers of series are 0 and 1 respectively 
   elif n==1: 
      return 0
   elif n==2: 
      return 1
   else: 
      return fibonacci(n-1)+fibonacci(n-2) 

# Driver program to test the above function 

print(fibonacci(9))
